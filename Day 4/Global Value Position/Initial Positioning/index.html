      <strong>Initial positioning</strong> refers to the default positioning of
      an element in a web page. It's the position an element takes before any
      CSS positioning properties are applied.
    </div>
    <p>
      By default, elements are positioned <strong>statically</strong>. This
      means they are placed in the normal flow of the document, one after the
      other. Each element takes up its natural space and is positioned relative
      to the previous element.
    </p>
    <h2>Key characteristics of initial positioning:</h2>
    <li>Elements are placed in the order they appear in the HTML document.</li>
    <li>Elements are positioned relative to each other.</li>
    <li>Elements do not overlap or float.</li>
    <p>
      <strong>Note: </strong>While initial positioning is a fundamental concept,
      it's often combined with other positioning properties like relative,
      absolute, fixed, or sticky to create more complex and dynamic layouts.
