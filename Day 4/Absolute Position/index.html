      Absolute positioned element is removed from the normal document flow, and

          We should also note that this value created a new stacking context
          when the value of z-index is not set to auto. The margins of
          absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse with other margins. If the
          element has margins, they are added to the offset, and the element
          establishes a new block formatting context for its contents.

          It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if there
          is any. Else, it is placed relative to the initial containing block.
          The final position of an element absolutely positioned is determined
          by the top, right, bottom, and left values.

    <title>Absolute Positioning Example</title>
    <style>
      .container {
        width: 400px;
        height: 200px;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }

      .box {
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: blue;
        position: absolute;
        top: 50px;
        left: 50px;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      Relative
      <div class="box">Absolut</div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Even after moving a relative postioned however It still holds it's orginal
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Absolutely positioned elements do not affect the layout of other elements.
      They can overlap or be overlapped by other elements.
    </p>

    <h2>In summary:</h2>
    <li><strong>Relative positioning</strong> is useful for creating subtle adjustments to an element's position within its normal flow</li>
    <li><strong>Absolute positioning</strong> is ideal for creating elements that are positioned precisely relative to a specific container or the entire page, and that do not affect the layout of other elements.</li>
    <p><strong>Note: </strong>Most of the time, absolutely positioned elements with height and width properties set up to auto are sized to fit their contents. However, non-replaced and absolutely positioned elements can fill the available vertical space when specified with both top and bottom properties leaving height.</p>
