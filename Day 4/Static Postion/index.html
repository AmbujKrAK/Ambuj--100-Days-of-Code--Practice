      Static is the default positioning for elements, and the elements remain
      'staticâ€™ to the regular page flow.

    <div id="box">Box Static</div>
    <p>
      So if a left/right/top/bottom and z-index properties are set, then these
      will have no effect. If we do not need an element to be rendered in a
      special way, then we can use this property. Here, the element is not a
      positioned box and is laid out according to its parent formatting context
      rules.
