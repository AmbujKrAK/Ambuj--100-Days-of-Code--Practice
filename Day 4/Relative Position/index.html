    <h1>
      Relative positioned element is an element whose computed position value is
      according to the document's normal flow. Then it offsets relative to
      itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
    </h1>
    <div id="box">Box Relative</div>
    <p>
      The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. Hence, the
      space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if the
      position were static.
    </p>
    <p>
      This value also creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index
      is not set to auto. If we have table-*-group, table-cell, and
      table-caption elements, then its effect on these elements remains
      undefined.
    </p>

    <p>
      The top and bottom properties specify the vertical offset from its normal
      position, while the left and right properties specify the horizontal
      offset. The offset is purely a visual effect and doesn't affect the size
      or position of any other box, except if there is a scrollable overflow
      area of its ancestors.
