      Sticky element is positioned according to the document's normal flow and
      then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing
      block.
    </h2>
    <div class="content">
      <strong>Note:</strong> A sticky element 'sticks' to its nearest ancestor with a 'scroll mechanism' even if that ancestor is not the nearest scrolling ancestor. This is created when the overflow property is set to hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay.
    </div>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If we use multiple stickily positioned boxes in the same container, then the offsets are independent and might overlap.</p>
