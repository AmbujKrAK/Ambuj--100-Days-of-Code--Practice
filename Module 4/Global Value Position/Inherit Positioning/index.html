      The position: inherit property tells an element to inherit its position
      from its parent element. This means the element will have the same
      positioning behavior as its parent.
    </h1>
    <div class="container">
      Container
      <div class="child">This is a child element.</div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <strong>Behavior:</strong>
      Since the .container has relative positioning, the .child element will
      also have relative positioning. This means the child element can be offset
      from its normal position within the container using the top, right,
      bottom, and left properties.
    </p>

      <strong>Key points about position: inherit:</strong>
      <li>
        It is primarily used to maintain the positioning behavior of child
        elements within a parent element that has a non-static position.
      </li>
      <li>
        It can be useful for creating consistent positioning within nested
        elements.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is often used in conjunction with other positioning properties like
        relative, absolute, or fixed to create complex layouts.
      </li>
