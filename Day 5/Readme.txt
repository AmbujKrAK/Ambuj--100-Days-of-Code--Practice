So this Module is all about Git & GitHub, just learning how to create branch, create repos, add your project to those repos, change files, add those commit, face conflicts check what the issue is with the new changes and add the final product to the feature branch.

After finalizing all changes commit the changes to the main branch by checkout to feature and merge to main.
